# godot-template
Template Git Repository for starting Godot projects

Fork this repository to get a good starting point on your next Godot project! Great for Game-jammers who need to get started quick!

# Project
The `/project` folder is where the Godot project lives. Use the pre-setup empty project and start developing!

# Builds
The [`/builds`](/builds) folder is where you should save your builds. It also includes some helpful scripts to automate builds, run html5 games, or even upload your game automatically to [itch.io](itch.io)!

# Mono
If you are using Godot Mono for C# development, you will want to rename your project **first** before creating any scripts/solutions. Godot requires the solution to have the same name as the project and it can be a huge pain to rename it after the fact.
